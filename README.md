# Human-protein-atlas-project
Single-cell type profiling of fetal kidney tissue
The aim of this project is to identify and prioritize relevant protein targets specific to fetal kidney tissue by leveraging a multi-omics approach. This involves the comprehensive analysis of transcriptomics data to uncover gene expression patterns unique to the fetal kidney, followed by the integration and validation of these findings with antibody-based proteomics data.
The fetal kidney, a dynamic site of nephron formation known as nephrogenesis, makes an ideal model for studying protein expression during human development.This study aimed to systematically map protein expression in fetal kidney tissues and compare it to adult kidney tissue using a multi-omics approach that integrates transcriptomics and antibody-based proteomics. Bulk mRNA sequencing data were analyzed from fetal kidney samples at two developmental stages (week 15 and week 18) to identify genes with significantly higher expression levels compared to adult kidney tissue. The functional roles of these genes were validated through Gene Ontology(GO) enrichment analysis, which highlighted key biological processes associated with kidney development. Protein localization and expression patterns were further examined and confirmed using Immunohistochemistry(IHC).
