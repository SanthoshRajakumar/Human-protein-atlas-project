The final dataset comprised approximately 20,163 genes, which were filtered using specific criteria to identify potential candidates for further analysis. Six separate lists were created based on distinct selection parameters detailed in Table 1.
Once the genes were selected in each sheet, further refinement was performed. For a gene to be considered for final analysis, Genes that were expressed highly in fetal kidney tissue compared to adult and had evidence from HPA LIMS(laboratory information management system) confirming RNA expression in kidney tissue were prioritized. Genes that were expressed in fetal kidney tissue but showed RNA expression in tissues other than kidney were also considered. Genes that exhibited high intensity staining in adult kidney tissue were excluded, as no significant difference in expression was expected in fetal kidney tissue. 
The data analysis identified a total of 2,355 genes with significantly higher expression levels in fetal kidneys compared to adult kidneys, filtered based on a threshold ratio of fetal to adult expression greater than 2. These genes are active in kidney development during  the fetal stages, showing distinct expression profiles that are significantly less expressed in adult kidneys.
In week 15, a wide range of genes with high expression was observed, as seen by numerous outliers with extremely high nTPM values in the scatter plot (Image 1). In contrast, week 18 displayed fewer genes with extremely high nTPM values compared to week 15, suggesting a continuation of developmental activity during the later fetal stage.
